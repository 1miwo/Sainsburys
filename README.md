Front End Developer Test

Michael Woodhead - Front End Developer Test

Test 1:

- I have tested this and it should work correctly in all web browsers including IE (10 +) 
- Although advised that JQuery is discouraged, I used this framework because its the one I am most familiar with
- I am very keen to learn new frameworks though and new ways of working

Test 2:
- I have included both the SCSS file and the CSS files
- As I didnt have an instance of SASS installed when I was developing, I used sassmeister to generate and validate  the code
- I have tested this for Chrome (42), Firefox (24), IE (10+) Safari (9)
- I have not used JavaScript to control any of the design, however if this website was going into production, 
  I would have considered using JavaScript to load in the side panels of the website so that it would reduce the file size for 
  mobile users (as these are hidden on Mobile)
